# The Great Trivia Game

This project is a questionnaire where end user will be dealing with various categories. They can play out the quiz game as a fun element that shuffles questions randomly to add a fun element.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines. 

#### Backend

From the backend folder run `pip install requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file. 

To run the application run the following commands: 
```
set FLASK_APP=app
set FLASK_DEBUG=True
py -m flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `app.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made.
The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 
```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000. 

### Tests
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands: 

```
python test_flaskr.py
```
All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality. 

## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys. 

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "Bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Unprocessable entity
